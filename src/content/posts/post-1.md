## Welcome

Thank you for joining me on this journey! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you
as I build this site using [Astro]("https://astro.build").

## Why Astro?

I have been researching over the last couple of weeks what the best tool for the job would be.

This site is not meant to be an application, but rather a content focused blog. I wanted to use a
tool that would allow me to focus on the content and not the tooling. I also wanted to use a tool
that would allow me to use the latest web technologies and not be tied to a specific framework.
Astro gives me that. I don't see myself writing components in Svelte or Vue or something, but you
never know, the option is there with Astro.

In addition, Astro has amazing documentation and their tutorials are top notch. I went through their
[Build a Blog Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction) and it was a blast. I
thoroughly enjoyed going through the tutorial and learning how to build with Astro.

I felt it had great pace to it and I was able to follow along and understand what was going on. I
highly recommend if you are looking to build a blog, give Astro a try.
