# Repository for philaf.dev, my website/blog

This is the repository for my website/blog, [philaf.dev](https://philaf.dev/), built using
[Astro](https://astro.build/).

I started off by going through the [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/), which
was a great starting point. I followed up by extending the blog with
[Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/).

I am now ready to go out on my own using what I have learned to build my using the tutorial as a
reference.
